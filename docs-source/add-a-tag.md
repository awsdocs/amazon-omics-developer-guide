# Adding a tag to an Omics resource<a name="add-a-tag"></a>

Adding tags to a resource can help you identify and organize your AWS resources and manage access to them\. First, you add one or more tags \(key\-value pairs\) to a resource\. You can use up to 50 tags per resource\. There are also restrictions on the characters that you can use in the key and value fields\. 

After you add tags, you can create IAM policies to manage access to the AWS resource based on these tags\. You can use the Omics console or the AWS CLI to add tags to a resource\. Adding tags to a repository can impact access to that repository\. Before you add a tag to a data store, review any IAM policies that might use tags to control access to resources such as data stores\.

Service tags are autogenerated for both a subject and a sample id for sequence stores\.

Follow these steps to use the AWS CLI to add a tag to an Omics resource\. For example, to add tags to a sequence store while it is being created, you would use the following command in the AWS CLI\. The name of the sequence store is MySequenceStore, and the two added tags with keys are key1 and key2 with values as value1 and value2 respectivelyâ€¨:

```
aws omics create-sequence-store --name "MySequenceStore" --tags key1=value1,key2=value2
```

The output does not list the tags\. It returns the following response\.

```
{
    "id": "6860403586",
    "referenceStoreId": "4889894479",
    "roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::555555555555:role/ImportTest",
    "status": "CREATED",
    "creationTime": "2022-07-21T01:19:07.194Z"
}
```

To add tags to an existing resource, you would run the following example command:

```
aws omics tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:omics:us-west-2:555555555555:sequenceStore/2275234794 --tags key1=value1,key2=value2         
```

If successful, this command returns no response\.
