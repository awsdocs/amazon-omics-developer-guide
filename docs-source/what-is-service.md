# What is Amazon Omics?<a name="what-is-service"></a>

Amazon Omics is an AWS service that helps users such as bioinformaticians, researchers, and scientists to store, query, analyze, and generate insights from genomics and other biological data\. It simplifies and accelerates the process of storing and analyzing genomic information for research and clinical organizations, and makes scientific discovery and insight generation faster\.

Omics has three primary components\. Omics Storage helps you store and share petabytes of genomics data efficiently and at low cost per gigabase\. Omics Analytics simplifies how you prepare genomics data for multiomics and multimodal analyses\. Omics Workflows automatically provisions and scales the underlying infrastructure for your bioinformatics computation\.

Amazon Omics is not intended to interpret or analyze clinical laboratory tests or other device data, results, and findings, and is not a substitute for third\-party tools intended for use in genomic analyses\.

## Features of Amazon Omics<a name="servicename-feature-overview"></a>

Omics offers the following features\.
+ Omics Storage — helps you store and share petabytes of raw genomics data efficiently and at low cost per gigabase\. 
+ Omics Analytics — simplifies how you prepare genomics data for multiomics and multimodal analyses\. 
+ Omics Workflows — automatically provisions and scales the underlying infrastructure for your bioinformatics workflows\.

Each component can be used independently or as part of an integrated end\-to\-end solution\. 

Omics offers you the following benefits\.
+ Securely store and combine genomic data — Omics integrates with other AWS services such as AWS Lake Formation and Amazon Athena\. You can securely store your genomics data and then query or combine it with medical history data for better diagnoses and personalized treatment plans\.
+ Protect patient privacy — Omics is GDPR compliant and HIPAA eligible\. It also integrates with IAM and Amazon CloudWatch so that you can control and log data access, as well as how the data has been used in analyses\. 
+ Built to scale — Support large population data analyses with simplified billing and new collaboration tools\.
+ Maximize efficiency — Use automated workflows and integrated tools to streamline data processing and analysis\.

You can use Omics for the following biomedical applications:
+ Population sequencing — Query thousands of genomes at once to understand how genomic variation maps to phenotypes across a population\.
+ Clinical genomics — Build reproducible genomics workflows from sequencer output to reportable data\. You can also optimize for high volume throughput and set the compute requirements for high\-priority clinical samples to reduce turnaround time\. 
+ Clinical trials — Integrate genome analysis into clinical trials to better understand the efficacy of new drug candidates\. Simplify and accelerate clinical trials with long\-term cost savings and data provenance to meet regulations from governing bodies\.
+ Enhance research and innovation — Streamline and control storage, access, and analysis of anonymized genomics data with built\-in row and column\-based access control\.
